**Including the initial parent process, how many processes are created by
the program shown in Figure 3.32?**


#### Figure 3.32

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    fork();
}
```


The number of processes that are created by the program showed in Figure 3.32, including the initial parent process is $$2^i$$
